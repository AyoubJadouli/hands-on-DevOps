### A hands-on DevOps course

<small>Created by Michael Joseph Walsh [mjwalsh@mitre.org](mailto:mjwalsh@mitre.org) /[walsh@nemonik.com](mailto:walsh@nemonik.com) / [@nemonik](http://twitter.com/nemonikl)</small>
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## This course will

- Discuss DevOps,
- Have you spin up a DevOps toolchain and development environment, and then
- Author two applications and their accompanying pipelines, the first a continuous integration (CI) and the second a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
We will be spending most of the course hands-on working with the tools and in the Unix command line making methods and repeated practices of DevOps happen, so as to grow an understanding of how DevOps actually works.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Don't fixate on the tools used, nor the apps we develop in the course of learning how and why.  How and why is far more important.  This course like DevOps is not about tools although we'll be using them. You'll spend far more time writing code.  (Or at least cutting-and-pasting code.)

## What is DevOps?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
DevOps (a clipped compound of the words `development` and `operations`) is [a software development methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process).
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
With an emphasis on a more reliable release pipeline, automation, and stronger collaboration across all stakeholders 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
With the goal of deploying working functionality into the hands of users (i.e., production) faster.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Yeah, that's the formal definition.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
I've grown to prefer the axiom:
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
*You are what you **code**.*
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### If you're a developer or software engineer

You're at least ***coding*** the application, its build automation, unit tests, and CI/CD (the combined practices of Continuouse Integrarion and Continuous Delivery) automation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### If a tester

You're ***coding*** typically the functional test automation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### If a security engineer

You're ***coding*** the compliance and policy test automation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### If ops

You're ***coding*** the deployment and infrastructure configuration management automation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### And since all these disciplines are ***coding***

They're essentially using the same methods and repeated practices to ensure they're producing good code.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
And they're all collectively doing all this coding left in the delivery pipeline, collaborating and from this springs forth culture.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What DevOps is not
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
DevOps is not entirely about tools.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Or as I like to put it, "Its not about the tools."
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
![My Pillow Guy](./images/my_pillow_guy.png)

<small>There are countless vendors out there, who want to sell you their crummy tool.</small>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
DevOps will also not entirely stop all bugs nor all vulnerabilities from making it into production, but that's not really the point.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## DevOps is really about

Providing the culture and delivery/release pipeline that once a bug or vulnerability is discovered, the concern can to be quickly remediated and functionality returned back to the user.
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How is it related to the Agile?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the [values](http://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) and [principles](http://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) expressed in the Agile Manifesto.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Agile Software Development shares the same goal, but DevOps extends Agile methods and practices by adding communication and collaboration between
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
development,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
quality assurance, and
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
technology operations
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
to ensure software systems are delivered in a rapid, reliable, low-risk manner.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
For Agile, solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams utilizing the appropriate practices for their context.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Again, in DevOps everyone is developing software, so it is my view DevOps builds on Agile.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How do they differ?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
While Agile Software Development encourages collaboration between cross-functional teams, the focus in DevOps is on the
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
inclusion of analysis,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
design,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
development, and
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
quality assurance functionaries as stakeholders into the development effort.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why?

In Agile Software Development, there is rarely an integration of these individuals outside the immediate application development team with members of technology operations (e.g., network engineers administrators, testers, cyber security engineers.)
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What are the principles of DevOps?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
As DevOps matures, several principles have emerged, namely the necessity for product teams to:
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Apply holistic thinking to solve problems,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Develop and test against production-like environments,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Deploy with repeatable, and reliable processes,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Remove the drudgery through automation,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Validate and monitor operational quality, and
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Provide rapid, automated feedback to the stakeholders
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How is this achieved?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Achieved through the repeated practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) often conflated into simply "CI/CD".
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
After tools, this is what is commonly (albeit mistakenly) thought to be the totality of DevOps.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

It is a repeated Agile software development practice, lifted specifically from Extreme programming, where members of a development team frequently integrate their work in order to detect integration issues as quickly as possible thereby shifting discovery of issues "left" (i.e., early) in the software release.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How?

Each integration is orchestrated through a CI service/orchestrator (e.g., Jenkins CI, Drone CI, GitLab Runners, Concourse CI) that essentially assembles a build, runs unit and integration tests every time a predetermined trigger has been met; and then reports with immediate feedback.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CI best practices
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Utilize a Configuration Management System

For the software's source code, where the mainline (i.e., master branch) is the most the most recent working version, past releases held in branches, and new features not yet merged into the mainline branch being worked on their own branches.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Automate the build

By accompanying build automation (e.g., Gradle, Apache Maven, Make) alongside the source code.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Employ one or more CI services/orchestrators

Perform source code analysis via automate formal code inspection and assessment.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Make builds self-testing

In other words, ingrain testing by including unit and integration tests (e.g., Spock, JUnit, Mockito, SOAPUI, go package *Testing*) with the source code so as to be executed by the build automation to be execute by the CI service.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Never commit broken

Or untested source code to the CMS mainline or otherwise risk breaking a build.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Developers are expected to pre-flight new code

Prior to committing source code in their own workspace.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The CI service/orchestrator provides feedback

On the success or fail of a build integration to all its stakeholders.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is Continuous Delivery?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
It is a repeated software development practice of providing a rapid, reliable, low-risk product delivery achieved through automating all facets of building, testing, and deploying software.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Extending Continuous Integration (CI)

With additional stages/steps aimed to provide ongoing validation that a newly assembled software build meets all desired requirements and thereby is releasable.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Consistency

Is achieved through delivering applications into production via individual repeatable pipelines of ingrained system configuration management and testing
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## But wait. What's a pipeline?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
A pipeline automates the various stages/steps (e.g., Static Application Security Testing (SAST), build, unit testing, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), secure configuration acceptance compliance, integration, function and non-functional testing, delivery, and deployment) to enforce quality conformance.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How is a pipeline manifested?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Each delivery pipeline is manifested as **Pipeline as Code** (i.e., software automation) accompanying software's source code in its version control repository.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What underlines all of this?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
I'd argue, _a ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort_ without the repeated practices of DevOps will struggle.  Although, it is possible to DevOps on mainframes.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## But really why do we automate err. code?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
In 2001, I think Larry Wall in his 1st edition of *Programming Perl* book put it best with "We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
laziness,
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
impatience, and
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
hubris."
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Why do I mention Larry Wall?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Well...
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

> _Once you have established yourself as an icon in your field
> it is important that you pay tribute  to some of the great legends that came before you.
> This kind of gesture will create the illusion that you’re still humble

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
I kid, but in all serious the sentimanet of this seminal book still holds true.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Let me explain.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Laziness

_The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer._ (p.609)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Impatience

_The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer._ (p.608)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Hubris

_Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also, the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer._ (p.607)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### We automate for
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Faster, coordinated, repeatable, and therefore more reliable deployments.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Discover bugs sooner. Shifting their discovery left in the process.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
To accelerates the feedback loop between Dev and Ops.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Reduce tribal knowledge, where one group or person holds the keys to how things get done. Yep, this is about making us all replaceable.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Reduce shadow IT (i.e., hardware or software within an enterprise that is not supported by IT. Just waiting for its day to explode.)
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Monitoring
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Once deployed, the work is done, right?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
A development team's work is not complete once a product leaves CI/CD and enters production; especially, under DevOps where the development teams include members of operations.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The most important metric

Is working software is the _primary_, but not the only, measure of progress.  The key to successful DevOps is knowing how well the methodology and the software it produces are performing.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### An Understanding of Performance

Is achieved by collecting and analyzing data produced by environments used for CI/CD and production.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Establish a baseline Performance

So, that improvements can be gauged and anomalies detected.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Set Reaction Thresholds

To formulate and prioritize reactions weighting factors, such as, the frequency at which an anomaly arises and who is impacted.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Reacting

A reaction could be as simple as operations instructing users through training to not do something that triggers the anomaly, or more ideally, result in an issue being entered into the product's backlog culminating in the development team delivering a fix into production.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Gaps in CI/CD

Monitoring will also inform development teams of gaps in CI/CD resulting in additional testing for the issue that triggered the necessity for the improvement.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Eliminating Waste

Further, monitoring may result in the re-scoping of requirements, re-prioritizing of a backlog, or the deprecation of un-used features.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is DevOps Culture?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
> **culture** noun  \ *ˈkəl-chər* \
> the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or
> organization
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Now that everyone is a coder using the same tools, methods and repeated practices for their particular discipline you have the foundations of a ***culture***.

### The pressures of social media

<small>
> The instinct to offend, or be offended, is cultivated by social media platforms and egged on by partisan online tabloid journalism. They curate the most egregious examples of outrage porn in a cynical ploy to keep us angry - sharing their articles and video clips to use as weapons in the culture war. Meanwhile, trolls and bots take advantage of this toxic environment to sow discord.

### The pressures of social media

<small>
> Conflict always attracts an audience. Just as the gladiators filled amphitheatres, Twitter - now routinely referred to by its own users as a 'hellsite' - provides a platform in which those battles can be fought in real time. And they are. Watching a Twitter spat is like watching people attempt to gouge each other's eyes out in written form. The audience is key. Whoever gets more 'likes' wins.
